# Project: AirBnB clone – The console

## Introduction  

The goal of this project is to simulate [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.fr/). We will deploy on our server a simple copy of it.  

**First, what is AirBnB platform?**  
Is a popular online marketplace and hospitality service that allows people to rent or lease short-term lodging, including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms (check the link above).  

In this project we won’t implement all the features ot this website, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher-level programming track.  

The final product is a complete web application that includes:  
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)  
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic  
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)  
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)  

**Note**: But for now, we will not take care of all the four components above of the final web app. We will start from the first piece of the project by:  
- create a data model  
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter  
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
